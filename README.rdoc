= to_xls gem

This gem transform an Array or Hash into a excel file using the spreadsheet gem.

== Usage

  @users = User.all

  @users.to_xls
  @users.to_xls(:headers => false)
  @users.to_xls(:columns => [:name, :role])
  @users.to_xls(:columns => [:name, {:company => [:name, :address]}])
  @users.to_xls(:columns => [:name, {:company => [:name, :address]}], :headers => [:name, :company, :address])

When invoked on a Hash each value is output to a separate sheet named after the corresponding key. Options for each sheet can be specified using key/values in the options hash.

  { :users => @users, :posts => @posts }.to_xls
  { :users => @users, :posts => @posts }.to_xls(:users => { :columns => [:name, :role] }, :posts => { :headers => [:title, :content] })

If you want to use the file, for example in rails, you have two options. The first one is saving it first, and using send_file:

  @users.to_xls.write '/path/to/file/users.xls'
  send_file '/path/to/file/users.xls'

The second option is using the method to_xls_data and send_data

  send_data @users.to_xls_data, :filename => 'users.xls'
    
The method to_xls_data accepts the same parameters as to_xls.

== Requirements

On rails, you might want to modify config/initializers/mime_types.rb and register a custom mime type there:

  Mime::Type.register "application/vnd.ms-excel", :xls  

== Example of use in Rails

In the controller where you want to export to excel, add the format.xls line.

  class UserController < ApplicationController

    def index
      @users = User.all

      respond_to do |format|
        format.html
        format.xml { render :xml => @users }
        format.xls { send_data @users.to_xls_data, :filename => 'users.xls' }
      end
    end
  end
